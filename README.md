# Squeak

[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/828986409171157001/embed.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/3Dgr4yQFdH)

Squeak is a private discord bot focused on helping your server to be extremely safe. Squeak is built to feel and behave similarly to [R0WB0AT](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/rowboat) made by b1nzy.

## Should I Run Squeak Locally?

Perhaps, Squeak is really difficult and complicated to run yourself, you'd need have a lot of knowledge in JS & TS. The main purpose of having the bot open-source is to allow others to understand and audit the functionality. The code is by no means meant to be easy to setup or bootstrap, and forks aren't supported. That being said, feel free to run a local version of Squeak for your server and **only** your server.

### Self-hosting Agreement

- Your instance of Squeak must only be for **your** server.
- Your instance of Squeak must not contain the bot's name or logo.
- You must not charge for the usage of your instance of Squeak.
- You may not provide support for Squeak as there is a DevMail for Squeak.

## Development

Squeak is maintained and developed by striped07 (A.K.A Circlify). Rouxl is just here to help with suggestions, whitelisting, hosting and more. Please do not ping, message or disturb them as they are very busy people.

## Can You Add Squeak To My Server?

Maybe, I am noot entirely sure I will, but you can feel free to ask! Please be considerate and message ModMail without pinging Circlify or Rouxl in the process. If you do get whitelisted, you will be friended by one of the Squeak staff giving you an oAuth2 invite for the bot in your server.
